## Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](https://github.com/MariamCHARRADA/BeautyBooking/blob/main/Architecture%20Diagram.png?raw=true)

The Beauty Booking app is structured into two main components:

- *Frontend (Client-Side)*: Built with React Native, providing a user-friendly interface where clients can explore services, make reservations, and manage their bookings. The frontend communicates with the backend through RESTful APIs.

- *Backend (Server-Side)*: Developed using Node.js and Express, the backend handles business logic, database operations, authentication, and API responses. It manages interactions with the MongoDB database, where all application data is stored and retrieved.

Here's how these components work together:

1. Users interact with the frontend to request services.
2. The frontend sends these requests to the backend via APIs.
3. The backend processes the requests, interacts with the database, and performs necessary operations.
4. Responses from the backend are sent back to the frontend to inform the user of the outcome.

   -> This architecture ensures a separation of concerns, with the frontend focused on user interaction and the backend on data management and business logic.
